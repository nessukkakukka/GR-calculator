This code attempts to calculate growth rates from new particle formation events with mode fitting, maximum concentration and appearance time methods. It compares their uncertainties and which methods work best for analyzing NPF events.

It is assumed that the data is of type .sum and one file has one day of measurements in 10 minute intervals. Particle sizes should range from approximately 3 nm to 1000 nm.
